```{r Pulling data from API}
# API KEY: 0YR02HPT5Z0LVCHN

# doge_test <- GET("https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=DIGITAL_CURRENCY_DAILY&symbol=DOGE&market=CNY&datatype=csv&apikey=0YR02HPT5Z0LVCHN")

# dogeparsed <- read.delim(text = content(doge_test, as = "text"), sep = ",")
#save(dogeparsed, file = "./data/DOGE.Rdata")
# only uncomment to update the data to the most recent

# Going to use Close Price, USD.
```

Start with a benchmark, and then include the lambda in auto.arima, look at week 3 for this example code
combine week 3 and 4 together
go with the lowest AIC
check residuals


# BEGIN PROJECT

```{r}
load(file = "./data/DOGE.Rdata")
```

```{r Explore Data}
head(dogeparsed)
dogeparsed$timestamp <- as.Date(dogeparsed$timestamp)
str(dogeparsed)
```
```{r Data Cleaning}
dogeparsed <- dogeparsed[c(1,9)]
doge_xts <- xts(dogeparsed[-1], order.by = dogeparsed$timestamp, frequency = 1)
doge_xts <- doge_xts[500:615]
colnames(doge_xts) <- c("close")
```

```{r Plotting}
autoplot(ts(doge_xts), main = "Dogecoin", xlab = "Time", ylab = "USD")
```

```{r Transformation}
BoxCox.lambda(doge_xts)
# -.5 value returned so there is a need for some transformation
# lets run it under the boxcox transformation auto and by manually setting the lamba value
plot(doge_xts)
plot(BoxCox(doge_xts,lambda="auto"))
plot(BoxCox(doge_xts,lambda = -.25))
```

```{r Explore the ACF before and after transformation and differencing}
tsdisplay(doge_xts) # original
tsdisplay(BoxCox(doge_xts, lambda = "auto")) # transformed
tsdisplay(diff(doge_xts)) # differencing
```

Differencing is the way to go.

```{r}
doge_xts_diff <- diff(doge_xts)
```


```{r Splitting the data}
doge_train <- doge_xts[1:92]
doge_test <- doge_xts[93:116]

doge_ts <- ts(doge_xts)
doge_train <- ts(doge_train)
doge_test <- ts(doge_test)

# differenced data
doge_train_diff <- doge_xts_diff[1:92]
doge_test_diff <- doge_xts_diff[93:116]

doge_ts_diff <- ts(doge_xts)
doge_train_diff <- ts(doge_train_diff)
doge_test_diff  <- ts(doge_test_diff)

```

Let's explore some simple forecasting methods

  autolayer(snaive_doge, series = "Seasonal Naive Method", PI = FALSE) +

# Seasonal Naive and Naive are the same here

# using lamba in functions
mean_doge_l <- meanf(doge_train, h = 24, lambda = -0.2568437)
